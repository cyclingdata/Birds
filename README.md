Using transfer learning to figure out if a picture contains a Kookaburra or a Cockatoo

Similar to Kaggle Cats vs Dogs competition, I have decided to use neural networks to classify Kookaburras and Cockatoos (so that's more Australian!)

The model is built in the 'Birds-model' notebook and is built on top of the Inception v3 model

The accuracy of the model is 96% in the test dataset.
